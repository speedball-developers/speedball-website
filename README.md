## Development - How to get started

VS Code Recommendend

#### Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Setup the project

Create a valid .env file using the .env.example as a base.
Ask one of the developers to give you the /stc/lib/server/schema.ts file.

#### Recommended VS Code Extensions:

ESLint, Prettier, Svelte for VS Code, Sherlock â€“ inspector for i18n

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> The app uses a node.js adapter and is uploaded onto a server using plesk and pm2. To learn more about other target environments take a look at other [adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters).

If the production build works, you can upload the /build/ folder, the package.json and the index.cjs files onto the server and let pm2 restart the application.
You may also want to create a new package-lock.json file and upload it to the server. To do so use the `pnpm install --save-exact` comand.

### Additional information

To add new translations, create them in the /messages/xx.json files and then run `pnpm build`. This will compile the language files and update the /lib/paraglide/messages/xx.js files from which the code imports its translations.

To generate new mysql schemata for drizzle use

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit introspect # dont use this if you dont know what it does
```

Keep in mind that introspect gives you a lot of false properties in your schema.ts which you need to fix manually.

---

To use the drizzle sql viewer in your browser use

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit studio # gives you a MySQL browser in your browser
```

The server json api could maybe be optimized by enabling compression. Take a look at the [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node#deploying-compressing-responses) for more info.
